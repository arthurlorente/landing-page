# landing-page

This project's purpose is to recreate a template of a landing page as a way to practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills.

As part of this exercise, I have found myself frequently returning to different explanations of the box model as well as CSS practice exercises that could help me understand how to better split the different sections of the page's layout.

After completing the first iteration of what I consider to be an acceptable version of this, it is clear that there is still a lot to improve, mainly with regards to reducing redundancies across the styling sheet. However, I am not sure I want to do this yet - I want to preserve this piece of work that I hope one day I will be able to see as "historical" so I can look back and understand how much progress I have made.

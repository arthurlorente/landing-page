# landing-page

This project's purpose is to recreate a template of a landing page as a way to practice fundamental HTML and CSS skills.

As part of this exercise, I have found myself frequently returning to different explanations of the box model as well as CSS practice exercises that could help me understand how to better split the different sections of the page's layout.
